# CrowPanel7inch
I've found the CrowPanel examples to be terrible, they don't work, have missing files and are badly written.

So here are some templates that I've written to get the CrowPanel 7" HMI display to work (ESP32).  If you find them useful great, if they don't work please let me know and I'll work to make this easier and easier to use.
